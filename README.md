This is a text editor program that runs in a web browser and meets the requirements for being a Progressive Web App (PWA).

  3. IndexedDB will immediately construct a database store when the text editor is opened.
  4. When you enter content and then close the DOM window, the content is saved with IndexedDB.
  The content will be retrieved from IndexedDB when the text editor is reopened after being closed.
  5. To download the online application as a desktop icon, click the Install button.
  6. When the web application is loaded, a registered service worker utilizing Workbox will be present.
  Pre-caching of static assets will be used.
